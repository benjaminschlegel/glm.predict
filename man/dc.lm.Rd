\title{
predicted values and discrete change
}
\description{
The function calculates the predicted values and the difference of
two cases with the confidence interval for a lm model.
}
\usage{
\method{dc}{lm}(model, values = NULL, sim.count = 1000, conf.int = 0.95, 
  sigma = NULL, set.seed = NULL, values1 = NULL, values2 = NULL,
  type = c("any", "simulation", "bootstrap"))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{model}{
the model-Object generated with lm()
}
  \item{values}{
the values of case 1 and 2 as vector in the order how they appear in the summary(model) Estimate. Values is if values1 and values2 are specified after each other in the same vector. Either values or values1 and values2 have to be specified.
}
  \item{sim.count}{
OPTIONAL numbers of simulations to be done by the function. default: 1000
}
  \item{conf.int}{
OPTIONAL the confidence interval used by the function. default: 0.95
}
  \item{sigma}{
OPTIONAL the variance-covairance matrix, can be changed when having for exaple robust or clustered vcov. default: vcov(model)
}
  \item{set.seed}{
OPTIONAL set a seed for the random number generator
}
  \item{values1}{
the values of case 1 as vector in the order how they appear in the summary(model) Estimate. Has to be definied if values is not definied.
}
  \item{values2}{
the values of case 2 as vector in the order how they appear in the summary(model) Estimate. Has to be definied if values is not definied.
}
  \item{type}{
OPTIONAL choose between simulation and boostrap, "any" chooses between those two
according to the number of cases (bootstrap if n < 1000)
}
}
\details{
  The function makes a simulation for the two cases and compares them to each other. 
}
\value{
  The output is a matrix have in the first colone the predicted values, in the second
  colone the lower value of the confidence interval and in the third colone the upper value
  of the confidence interval.

\examples{
model1 = lm(Pulse ~ Height + Smoke, data=MASS::survey)
summary(model1)
# comparing a person with the height 150cm to 151cm
dc(model1, values1 = c(1,150,1,0,0),
  values2 = c(1,151,1,0,0))
# the difference is not significant, because the confidence interval
# includes the 0
